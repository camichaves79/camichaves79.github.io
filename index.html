                                and
                                in an integration of a third party's APK with our mobile app code. <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>The Tech Stack</strong> <br>In this modern tech stack, Python served as the
                                backend
                                language, orchestrating the interaction between various services. DocumentDB and
                                DynamoDB
                                were employed as NoSQL databases, offering flexible data storage. <br><br> The system's
                                gateway to
                                the outside world was managed by Amazon API Gateway, which seamlessly connected
                                with
                                AWS
                                Lambda, facilitating serverless compute functionality. Email communication was
                                streamlined
                                through AWS Simple Email Service (SES), while Simple Notification Service (SNS)
                                handled
                                messaging. <br><br>User authentication and management were delegated to Amazon Cognito.
                                REST
                                and
                                HTTP APIs enabled smooth communication between components. The React Native app,
                                coded in
                                Typescript, served as the dynamic and responsive frontend. <br><br> Version control was
                                managed using

                                deployment. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) secured communication, and third-party APIs
                                expanded the
                                system's capabilities, creating a robust, scalable, and versatile technological
                                ecosystem.

                                <strong>The team</strong><br> For this project the team was conformed by 2 backend
                                developers,
                                2 frontend developers, a lead developer, and a product owner (CTO). As well as
                                the
                                support
                                from an international business partner's team in the use of their API. <br>

                                <strong>The Problem</strong><br> The challenge in developing this mobile app lies
                                in
                                designing and implementing a
                                functional digital wallet system. This system should enable users to securely
                                store
                                and share various life achievements, encompassing educational certificates, work
                                history, recommendations, and badges. <br><br>The primary objective is to create a
                                robust
                                and user-friendly mobile application that effectively manages and facilitates
                                the
                                sharing of diverse personal accomplishments within a secure digital
                                environment.<br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>The Solution </strong><br>
                                To address the specified problem, as it pertains to th backend, a comprehensive
                                solution was implemented, centered
                                around a REST API designed to manage the creation, reception, storage, and
                                retrieval
                                of credentials. <br><br>These credentials were verified by a third-party Internet of
                                Credentials provider. The primary databases employed in this solution were NoSQL
                                databases, chosen for their flexibility and scalability, as well as for the
                                compatibility with the ceredentials data format. <br><br>

                                Proper encryption measures were implemented both at rest and in transit to
                                ensure
                                the security of sensitive data. The handling, transformation, and presentation
                                of
                                various credential types were standardized using the JSON format, providing a
                                structured and interoperable data format. <br><br>

                                For user interactions, a secure user authentication and authorization system was
                                established, safeguarding access to the stored credentials. This included robust
                                mechanisms to verify the identity of users and control their access privileges.
                                <br><br>
                                The mobile application seamlessly interacted with the REST API, utilizing it as
                                a
                                backend service to retrieve and display user information. <br><br>This approach ensured
                                a
                                smooth and secure user experience, allowing individuals to manage and share
                                their
                                life achievements with confidence in the integrity and privacy of their
                                credentials.

                                and
                                phone verification, respectively. <br><br>This strategic use of AWS services ensured the

                            <strong>My Role</strong> <br>Backend. I handled (under the supervision of the lead
                            developer and CTO) the implementation of this email event data streaming ETL pipeline.
                            Throughout the coding, testing, deployment and maintenance of the system, I participated as
                            a
                            backend
                            developer.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The Tech Stack</strong> <br>This tech stack is centered around Node.js for
                            server-side
                            logic, emphasizing asynchronous operations and scalability for web applications. AWS Lambda
                            is
                            specifically used for processing data received through SES (Simple Email Service), handling
                            email data and storing it in Amazon S3, serving as the foundation for data storage and
                            management within this architecture. <br>
                            <br>
                            Amazon Kinesis Firehose takes on the role of managing real-time data streaming, capable of
                            capturing, transforming, and loading streaming data into Amazon S3. This facilitates further
                            analytics and data processing tasks, leveraging the seamless integration within the AWS
                            ecosystem. <br>
                            <br>
                            AWS Glue plays a key part in preparing and transforming the SES data stored in S3 for
                            analysis,
                            automating the ETL (extract, transform, load) processes, which is essential for organizing
                            data
                            into a query-able format. This structured data is then made available for interactive
                            querying
                            with Amazon Athena, which uses standard SQL to query data directly within Amazon S3,
                            offering
                            powerful data analysis capabilities without the need for a traditional database. <br>
                            <br>
                            The analysis results can be visualized and explored through Amazon QuickSight, which
                            provides
                            interactive dashboards and visualizations. QuickSight's integration with Athena and direct
                            access to S3 data enables comprehensive insights and analytics derived from the processed
                            SES
                            data. <br>
                            <br>
                            In summary, this tech stack uses Node.js for its application logic, with AWS Lambda
                            processing
                            SES data for storage in S3. Amazon Kinesis Firehose, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon
                            QuickSight form a pipeline that captures, processes, analyzes, and visualizes data,
                            demonstrating a cohesive flow of data processing and analysis within the AWS cloud
                            environment.<br>

                            <strong>The team</strong> <br>For this project the team was conformed by 1 backend
                            developer,
                            a lead developer, and a product owner (the CTO). <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The Problem</strong><br> The challenge involved designing and implementing a
                            comprehensive
                            email event tracking system. This system needed to
                            accurately capture, monitor, and log various email-related events, including, but not
                            limited
                            to, emails being sent, opened, and bounced. <br><br>Furthermore, it required the extraction,
                            processing,
                            and loading (ETL) of this data into a format that is conducive to analysis and could
                            subsequently
                            be leveraged to derive actionable insights for the marketing department, thereby
                            facilitating
                            data-driven decision-making and enhancing marketing strategies.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The Solution</strong><br>
                            The solution was to develop a streamlined pipeline that captures Simple Email Service (SES)
                            events in real-time, extracts this data on the fly, and transforms and loads it as needed.
                            This
                            approach keeps the marketing team's BI insights fresh, empowering them with up-to-the-minute
                            data to inform their strategies.<br>
