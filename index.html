                                    <br>
                                    <strong>The Solution: </strong>
                                    To address the specified problem, as it pertains to th backend, a comprehensive
                                    solution was implemented, centered
                                    around a REST API designed to manage the creation, reception, storage, and retrieval
                                    of credentials. These credentials were verified by a third-party Internet of
                                    Credentials provider. The primary databases employed in this solution were NoSQL
                                    databases, chosen for their flexibility and scalability, as well as for the
                                    compatibility with the ceredentials data format.

                                    Proper encryption measures were implemented both at rest and in transit to ensure
                                    the security of sensitive data. The handling, transformation, and presentation of
                                    various credential types were standardized using the JSON format, providing a
                                    structured and interoperable data format.

                                    For user interactions, a secure user authentication and authorization system was
                                    established, safeguarding access to the stored credentials. This included robust
                                    mechanisms to verify the identity of users and control their access privileges.

                                    The mobile application seamlessly interacted with the REST API, utilizing it as a
                                    backend service to retrieve and display user information. This approach ensured a
                                    smooth and secure user experience, allowing individuals to manage and share their
                                    life achievements with confidence in the integrity and privacy of their credentials.

                            <br>
                            <strong>The Solution: </strong>
                            The solution to the identified problem involved the development of a secure REST API,
                            leveraging the serverless architecture of AWS Lambda and API Gateway. This approach
                            facilitated scalability and simplified maintenance. At the heart of the user authentication
                            service was Amazon Cognito, which provided a comprehensive set of features for managing
                            users, handling authentication, and ensuring security. The integration with the boto3
                            library allowed for programmatic interaction with AWS services, thereby enhancing the
                            system's functionality. <br>
                            <br>
                            To enhance the system's security and user validation mechanisms, the solution included the

                        <br>
                        AWS Glue plays a key part in preparing and transforming the SES data stored in S3 for analysis,
                        automating the ETL (extract, transform, load) processes, which is essential for organizing data
                        into a query-able format. This structured data is then made available for interactive querying
                        with Amazon Athena, which uses standard SQL to query data directly within Amazon S3, offering
                        powerful data analysis capabilities without the need for a traditional database. <br>
                        <br>
                        The analysis results can be visualized and explored through Amazon QuickSight, which provides
                        interactive dashboards and visualizations. QuickSight's integration with Athena and direct
                        access to S3 data enables comprehensive insights and analytics derived from the processed SES
                        data. <br>
                        <br>
                        In summary, this tech stack uses Node.js for its application logic, with AWS Lambda processing
                        SES data for storage in S3. Amazon Kinesis Firehose, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon
                        QuickSight form a pipeline that captures, processes, analyzes, and visualizes data,
                        demonstrating a cohesive flow of data processing and analysis within the AWS cloud
                        environment.<br>

                        <strong>The team:</strong> For this project the team was conformed by 1 backend
                        developer,
                        a lead developer, and a product owner (the CTO). <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The Problem:</strong> The challenge involved designing and implementing a comprehensive
                        email event tracking system. This system needed to
                        accurately capture, monitor, and log various email-related events, including, but not limited
                        to, emails being sent, opened, and bounced. Furthermore, it required the extraction, processing,
                        and loading (ETL) of this data into a format that is conducive to analysis and could
                        subsequently
                        be leveraged to derive actionable insights for the marketing department, thereby facilitating
                        data-driven decision-making and enhancing marketing strategies.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The Solution: </strong>
                        The solution was to develop a streamlined pipeline that captures Simple Email Service (SES)
                        events in real-time, extracts this data on the fly, and transforms and loads it as needed. This
                        approach keeps the marketing team's BI insights fresh, empowering them with up-to-the-minute
                        data to inform their strategies.<br>
